Advanced To-Do List Application
Project Summary
This project implements a feature-rich command-line To-Do List application in C++. The application solves the common problem of task management by providing a robust system for creating, organizing, and tracking tasks. It demonstrates object-oriented programming principles, data persistence, and user interface design in a console environment.
Key Features

Task management (add, remove, update)
Priority levels (Low, Medium, High)
Task status tracking (Pending, In Progress, Completed)
Category-based organization
Due date management
File-based persistence
Overdue task tracking

Technical Excellence
The project showcases several areas of technical strength:

Object-Oriented Design: The code implements a clear separation of concerns between the Task and TaskManager classes, demonstrating strong object-oriented principles including encapsulation and single responsibility.
Data Structures: Efficient use of STL containers (vector) for task storage and management, showing understanding of C++ standard library.
File I/O: Robust implementation of data persistence using file operations, ensuring task data survives between program executions.
Error Handling: Comprehensive input validation and error checking throughout the application.
Memory Management: Effective use of C++ smart pointers and standard library containers to prevent memory leaks.

Areas for Enhancement
While the current implementation is functional, several improvements could make it more robust:

Database Integration: Replace file-based storage with a proper database system for better data management and querying capabilities.
Security Features:

Implement user authentication
Add input sanitization for all user inputs
Encrypt sensitive data in storage


Performance Optimization:

Implement more efficient search algorithms for large task lists
Add indexing for faster task retrieval
Optimize memory usage for large datasets



Technical Challenges
The most challenging aspects of the project included:

Date Handling: Implementing the due date system required deep understanding of C++'s chrono library and time management functions. This was overcome by extensive research into the std::chrono library documentation and testing various approaches.
File Persistence: Creating a reliable file storage system that could handle all task attributes while maintaining data integrity was complex. The solution involved careful design of the file format and robust error handling.
Status Management: Implementing the state machine for task status transitions required careful consideration of possible states and valid transitions.

Transferable Skills
This project developed several valuable skills applicable to future work:

Data Structure Design: Experience in designing and implementing complex data structures
